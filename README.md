# BookingSystem

## Description 


### Story 
During the COVID lockdown many companies have reshaped their offices due to the remote working. As a result the office space became a lot smaller and many of the employees would like to keep the remote working in place and come maybe once or twice a week to the office. Therefore, the problem is that everyone has to know which and what desks and rooms are free in the office when they are coming.

### Functionality
The user would be able to login into his account.

The user would be able to see his bookings in 'My Bookings' section. 

The user would be able to book desks/rooms which are free from the 'Book' section.

The user is able to select the dates that he wants to book a desk/room for. 

The administrator/project manager is able to see his team when each one of them are in the office, on-site (based on booking dates).

### Platform users 
The platform is meant for employees of a company that are seeking to book their office time and the office/station that they are going to use during that day at the office.
The platform can be used also for tenants of a building to book the laundry or anything else that can be booked.

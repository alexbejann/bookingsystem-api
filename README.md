## Description 

### Story 
During the COVID lockdown many companies have reshaped their offices due to the remote working. As a result the office space became a lot smaller and many of the employees would like to keep the remote working in place and come maybe once or twice a week to the office. Therefore, the problem is that everyone has to know which and what desks and rooms are free in the office when they are coming.

### Platform users 
The platform is meant for employees of a company that are seeking to book their office time and the office/station that they are going to use during that day at the office.
